            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Roman Shor, Ph.D., P.Eng., is an Associate Professor in the Harold Vance Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University. Previously, he was an Associate Professor and the Energi Simulation Industrial Research Chair in Geothermal Systems at the University of Calgary. He holds a BA in mathematics and a BSE and MSE in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania and an MSE and PhD in petroleum engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. He is interested in energy systems, the interplay of renewable and traditional energy sources, systems thinking, and sustainability.</p>

            <p>He leads the Wells for the Future Consortium at Texas A&amp;M and his research interests lie in the areas of drillstring dynamics modelling and control, drilling optimization, drilling systems automation and drilling in extreme environments. His team explores topics in deep drilling systems with the goal of reducing well costs to enable deep geothermal systems. He also applies machine learning techniques to problems in the energy sector and is interested in reducing the impact of drilling operations on the environment and surrounding communities. He collaborates with researchers around the world on topics in geothermal energy, drill string dynamics, and the subsurface as an energy asset. He continues his collaboration with researchers in the Energi Simulation Centre for Geothermal Systems Research at the University of Calgary to help plan, develop and monitor geothermal demonstration projects throughout Western Canada.</p>
